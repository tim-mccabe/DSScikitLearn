## Array Shape

The IRIS dataset was loaded into *data_raw* variable.

Assign the value for the `'data'` key (numpy array) to the *data* variable. Then assign the value for the `'target'` key (numpy array) to the *target* variable.

In response, print the shape of these arrays (*data*, *target*) to the console.

#### Expected result:

```
(150, 4)
(150,)
```
